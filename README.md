# Animal Mandi - by Team Misfits

Streamlining the buying and selling of cattle. An integrated system of a website and a mobile application.



## What we made and our Problem Statement

We have made an integrated system of a website and a mobile application to make it easier for farmers to
 buy and sell their cattle and poultry.

Farmers in India buy and sell cattle and poultry on a daily basis but have to do so in their local markets or from local vendors at high prices and without many options.




## Features

- Availaibility and Accessibility (Availaible in various regional languages)
- Ease (Great UI and easy to pick up)
- Tracking (Keeps track of all the cattle bought and sold)
- Authenticity (Checks authenticity of cattle and poultry)


## Roadmap

- Enhanced platform for user experience.

- Unique id for all cattle using IoT sensors.

- Conservation of animals for better ecology and sustainaibility.
